This feature effectively blocks unauthorized access and ensures the security of network resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encrypted Communication Based on WireGuard</p> <p>AstroWarp\u2019s communication encryption adopts the WireGuard protocol, providing robust security for various application scenarios and needs.</p> <p>WireGuard: </p> <p>WireGuard is a foundational element of AstroWarp\u2019s communication infrastructure, offering a fast, modern, end-to-end encrypted VPN connection. WireGuard leverages state-of-the-art cryptography to secure connections between devices. Its design has undergone extensive cryptographic review and auditing, with only minor issues identified and resolved.</p> <p>Key design principles include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Advanced Encryption Technology: Utilizes industry-leading cryptographic algorithms such as the Noise protocol framework, Curve25519, ChaCha20, Poly1305, and BLAKE2 to ensure communication security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Minimized Attack Surface: Through minimalistic design, WireGuard reduces potential vulnerabilities.

User internet traffic remains uninspected.</li> </ul> <p>Even in extreme scenarios (e.g., cloud node failures), AstroWarp maintains device-to-device connectivity through point-to-point (P2P) methods, ensuring high availability and user independence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Globally Distributed Node Architecture</p> <p>AstroWarp provides globally distributed cloud nodes and disaster recovery servers, enabling automatic switching under the following conditions:</p> <ul> <li>Single Point of Failure: If a cloud node server in a specific region goes down, AstroWarp automatically switches to backup nodes in other regions.</li> <li>Network Instability: When P2P connections are unstable, cloud nodes act as relays to maintain continuous communication.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Currently, AstroWarp's cloud nodes span North America, Europe, and Asia.
